api.py is our main python file that should be run in the following way:
python3 api.py localhost 5000

api_tests contains our testing suite and expected outputs.

Within the folder static, we have the css file that styles our frontpage,
called main.css. The folder also contains worldmap.jpg, which is a picture
of a world map.

Within the folder templates, we have our main html file, which is frontpage.html
